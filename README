About
Dungeon Client is an application geared towards simplicity of D&D character setup, which typically takes quite a long time, and can detract from the experience of a onetime campaign. \n\nThis is accomplished by a moderate amount of automation, but not enough to remove control from the player/DM. \n\nThis automation allows for speedy character creation by removing the need to constantly refer to the Player's Handbook.\n\nBut remember: There is nothing like rolling two handfulls of d6's.
